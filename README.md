# Fluent and XLIFF experimentation

With a bridge between Fluent and XLIFF, we might be
able to get some Fluent functionality into CAT tools,
without actual in-tool Fluent support.

We're targeting XLIFF 2.0.

## Test bed

* two languages, different message count
* partial existing translations
* group comments
* plural selector
* placeable (<a href={$url}>foopy</a>)
* terms and term references
* DATETIME builtin
